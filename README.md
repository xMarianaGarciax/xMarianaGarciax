<h3> Hi reader! </h3>

I'm Mariana (Mari), a Brazilian Bachelor in Public Administration with â‰… 5 years of experience at governmental organizations, currently studying to become a Web Development Analyst. Nice too meet you!

My interest in programming started growing at the end of graduation, when one teacher had me and my classmates to present app prototypes as a propose of intervention to public problems of our choice. 

My team choose to work with domestic animals welfare in our city. Each of us was suposed to design 5 screens for the app (nothing complex as we were not designers or programmers). I designed 25. _It was an time since i've been this excited over an college work_.

Now my goal is to be capable of turning this project and others an reallity! 

If you liked my profile feel free to follow (I will be following back, promise!) or just send me an invite on my social network's. I'm looking foward to make real conections on this developer journey â˜†
